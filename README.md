FEUP - Distributed Systems Projec  
  
UmaFrancesinha is a distributed systems project with the ultimate goal to rate and check the better restaurants to eat a Francesinha, one of Porto's traditional dishes.  
  
It uses concurrency in the access to the database in order to have multiple users at the same time.  
  
Once someone rates a restaurant's Francesinha it is updated on every user's device.  
  
A user-rating system is integrated in order to penalize those whose rates are not trustworthy and those evaluations won't count to the rating system.  
  
There is also a notification system in case any restaurant decides to do a last minute discount and warn its clients. In this case, the clients receive immediatly the notification in their application.
